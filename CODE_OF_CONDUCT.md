# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment,
we as contributors and maintainers pledge
to make participation in this project
a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability,
ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance,
race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes
to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language  
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences  
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism  
- Showing empathy toward other community members  

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery
  and unwelcome sexual attention or advances  
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments,
  and personal or political attacks  
- Public or private harassment  
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission  
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered
  inappropriate in a professional setting  

## Our Responsibilities

Maintainers are responsible for clarifying
the standards of acceptable behaviour
and are expected to take appropriate
and fair corrective action in response
to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.

As this project is largely unmaintained,
moderation decisions may be infrequent,
but serious concerns will be reviewed
and addressed as needed.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces
and applies when an individual is representing
the Fullscreen Clock project in any public or community context,
including GitHub Issues, pull requests, discussions,
or other communication channels.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour
may be reported by contacting the project maintainer
at `bpg1968@gmail.com`.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated
and will result in a response that is deemed
necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from
the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org),
version 2.1.
